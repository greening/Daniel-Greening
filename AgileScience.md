# Scrum

> Definition: Scrum is rhythmic experimentation to improve production.

Traditional project management, often called "waterfall", has a damning history of failure. In the past 40 years, 25% of software projects were cancelled with estimated cost of $55 billion per year [Standish]. 49% exceed their expected budget or fail to deliver planned functionality. Only 26% could be called successful. 

Organizations _abandoned_ the projects shown in the table below. Every project listed cost more than $12m.
